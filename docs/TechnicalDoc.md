# Smart Luxury Technical Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the technical documentation for Smart Luxury, a Web 3 full-stack project that consists of an online store that sells fashion goods with authenticity and delivery guaranteed by smart contracts.

Our platform is built on the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes smart contracts to ensure that all of our products are authentic and that delivery is guaranteed. We have three main smart contracts that make up our platform:

- **SellingContract**: this contract is responsible for the management of the sales. It allows sellers to register new products, list them for sale, and remove them from sale. It also allows buyers to deposit earnest money, approve the sale after delivery, and finalize the sale.

- **FashionToken**: this contract is responsible for the creation of a custom ERC-20 token to store the products' metadata. Each product is represented by a unique token that contains information such as the product's name, description, and image URL.

- **Contacts**: This contract is responsible for storing information about the first name, last name, and address of the registered customers, based on their MetaMask address.

The next sections will provide a detailed explanation of the functions and logic of each contract, as well as instructions on how to use and interact with them.
